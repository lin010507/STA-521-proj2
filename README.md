To reproduce our results, we provide the following files:  
(1)PROJ2-writeup.tex, the raw Latex used to generate the report  
(2)PROJ2-code.rmd, the code written for all parts. One can easily get all the figures and plots just by running the code chunk by chunk. In detail, part 1 is to load data, plot labeled maps and perform EDA, part 2 is to do data split, calculate baseline accuracy and find the best features, part 3 is to compare different models using multiple ways, and part 4 is to further analyze the random forest model we choose as the best.  
(3)CVmaster.R, the generic cross validation function written for 2d.
